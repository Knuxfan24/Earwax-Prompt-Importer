# Earwax Prompt Importer
Very sloppy cmd app that converts plain text into a prompt file for the game Earwax in The Jackbox Party Pack 2. To use, simply build the project then drag a text file onto the resulting executable to get a `.jet` file (really just a `.json` file) that can replace the original `EarwaxPrompts.jet` file in your Earwax content directory (`{INSTALLDIR}\The Jackbox Party Pack 2\games\Earwax\content`).

This doesn't write the `PromptAudio` key correctly, but this causes the game to just not play any audio for the prompts. If this is corrected (changing `promptAudio` to `PromptAudio` in the resulting `.jet` file) then sound files MUST be present in the EarwaxPrompts directory (`{INSTALLDIR}\The Jackbox Party Pack 2\games\Earwax\content`), named `custom_{PROMPTNUMBER}.ogg`, where `{PROMPTNUMBER}` is the index of your prompt in your initial text file (so a sound file for the fifth prompt in the list would be `custom_4.ogg`). Prompt audio hasn't actually been tested, so it's a guess as to whether this would actually work or not.
