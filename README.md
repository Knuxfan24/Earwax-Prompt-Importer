# Earwax Prompt Importer
Very sloppy cmd app that converts plain text into a prompt file for the game Earwax in The Jackbox Party Pack 2. To use, simply build the project then drag a text file onto the resulting executable to get a `.jet` file (really just a `.json` file) that can replace the original `EarwaxPrompts.jet` file in your Earwax content directory (`{INSTALLDIR}\The Jackbox Party Pack 2\games\Earwax\content`). This will also create OGG files which are simple Text to Speech generations of the prompt text. Place these into the EarwaxPrompts directory (`{INSTALLDIR}\The Jackbox Party Pack 2\games\Earwax\content\EarwaxPrompts`).

A prompt can italisice part by using the standard `<i></i>` html tags, or a player name by using an `<ANY>` tag where you want the name to show.
